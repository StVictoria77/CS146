    "1. Mean: \"The mean of the data is approximately 2.3 ± 0.5\". For this distribution, mu_0 is just equal mu_0, with no other parameters involved. It means that the mu_0 must be constrained to (mu_0 - 2.3)^2 to minimize the sum of squared residuals.  Hence, mu_0 = x[0], and the term (x[0] - 2.3)^2  is the first in the function.\n",
    "2. Variance of mean: \"The mean of the data is approximately 2.3 ± 0.5\". The variance of mean for this distribution is defined as beta/(alpha - 1), so our constraint is (beta/(alpha - 1) - 0.5)^2. If we define alpha_0 = x[1], beta_0 = x[2], then the next term of the function will be (x[2]/(x[1] - 1) - 0.5)^2.\n",
    "3. Variance of data: \"The variance of the data is approximately 2.75 ± 1.\". For this distribution, the variance of the data is defined as beta/(alpha - 1)lambda, where lambda is nu_0. So, if we define nu_0 = x[3], then our constraint will be (x[2]/(x[1] - 1)x[3] - 2.75)^2.\n",
    "4. Variance of the variance of data: \"The variance of the data is approximately 2.75 ± 1.\". For this distribution, it is defined as (beta^2)/((alpha - 1)^2(alpha - 2)). Hence, our final term will be ((x[2]^2)/((x[1] - 1)^2(x[1] - 2)) - 1)^2."
